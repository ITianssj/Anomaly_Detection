# Anomaly_Detection
An anomaly, in the context of data analysis and machine learning, refers to an observation or data point that significantly deviates from the expected or normal behavior within a dataset. Anomalies are also commonly referred to as outliers or anomalies detection, and they can represent data points that are rare, unusual, or unexpected compared to the majority of the data.

Anomalies can occur in various types of data, including numerical, categorical, and time-series data. Detecting anomalies is crucial in many applications, such as fraud detection, network security, quality control in manufacturing, medical diagnosis, and more. The identification of anomalies allows organizations to take corrective actions or investigate unusual events.

Here are a few common examples of anomalies:

Credit Card Fraud: Unusual and unexpected transactions that deviate from a cardholder's typical spending behavior can be flagged as anomalies and may indicate fraudulent activity.

Manufacturing Defects: In a production line, products with abnormal measurements or characteristics that differ from the standard specifications can be considered anomalies and should be inspected for defects.

Network Intrusions: Anomalous patterns of network traffic, such as an unusually high volume of data transfer or unusual access patterns, may indicate a security breach or cyberattack.

Medical Diagnosis: In healthcare, abnormal patient test results, such as unusually high or low values for vital signs, can be indicative of health issues or diseases.
